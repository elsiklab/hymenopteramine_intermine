#contains only classes that come from more than one source
#for each class contained every source for that class must be listed

# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:
#
# ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, uniprot

# To give flybase priority over all other sources for Gene name:
#
# Gene.name = flybase, *

DataSource.url = update-data-sources, *
ECOTerm.ontology = evidence-ontology, *
# GFFs should have priority over alias sources for SO term. Rather than spelling out 100+ gff sources here, simply demote the alias sources:
MRNA.sequenceOntologyTerm = *, aech-aliases, aflo-aliases, amel-aliases, bter-aliases, cflo-aliases, dnov-aliases, emex-aliases, hlab-aliases, hsal-aliases, lalb-aliases, mrot-aliases, mqua-aliases, obir-aliases, sinv-aliases
Protein.sequence = uniprot-to-refseq, *
